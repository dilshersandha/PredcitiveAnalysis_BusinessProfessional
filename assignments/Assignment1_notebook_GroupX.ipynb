You can use any of the models you're comfortable with. As well, we want to be able to predict as accurately as possible, so you'll need to use some sort of metric to evaluate your model and (probably) make some changes to improve it. These changes can include things like changing the model, changing the features changing the hyperparameters, or considering factors such as target distribution or collinearity.\n",
